            <h2>Building minimum viable security in SMBs</h2>
            <p>I published a framework for how to build a minimum viable security program in a small company of ~10 to maybe 100 employees. It was not an easy thing to do, nor did it happen overnight. This talk will describe the journey.</p>
            <p>I would like to walk the audience through a 4 year journey of going from absolutely clueless about cyber security to a state where I can proudly proclaim that I know a little about a few specific areas. The journey was long and hard, but I had to do it. Most SMBs do not have someone to do this and do not know that they should be doing it at all. How do they defend themselves and how do we help them do it better on a large scale?</p>

            <h2>Mitigating Java Deserialization attacks from within the JVM</h2>
            <p>It is known that Deserialization in Java is highly insecure and can be easily abused resulting in RCE and DoS attacks. The publication of these attacks exposed critical vulnerabilities in numerous Java applications and products, in all layers of the Java software stack. Because deserialization exploits are complex in nature, developers and code reviewers often fail to detect deserialization abuse cases. In this talk we will discuss the problem of Java deserialization. Developers and security code reviewers will learn how to identify dangerous code that can lead to new gadgets and how to avoid them. We will also discuss how the new Java Serialization Filtering (JEP 290) can help developers and security teams mitigate such attacks.</p>
            <p>A live demo will also show how to bypass an existing popular solution.</p>
            <p>Finally, we will present the root cause of these attacks from a different point of view and propose a new approach for protecting the JVM.</p>
            <p>Keywords: Java, JVM, Deserialization, Gadget Chains, AppSec</p>

            <h2>To click or not to click, or how to build awareness about behavior online</h2>
            <p>One of the largest problem we face in and about cyber security is human error. By many investigations it came out that internal data breach goes even till 81,6 % (investigation by Verzion). This shows how important it is to make employees at hospitals/companies aware of the importance of both good cyber security and their good and sensible behavior online at the workplace. I will explain how we can reach the employee to be open and want to learn more about good behavior online. The basic training with few rules from and for IT department will bring the awareness on higher level, so we can eliminate the ability of the bad and average criminal hackers to harm the company and everyone in there.</p>

            <h2>Automated Mail Server Testing - "Like SSL Labs, but for email"</h2>
            <p>What is the first thing you do when bringing a web server online? You check its score using SSL Labs to see if it is configured correctly or if there are any security-critical things you might have missed along the way. It's an invaluable tool for monitoring and analyzing the TLS setup of any public web server. But what do you do after you brought your email servers online? Your SMTP, POP, and IMAP servers? Wouldn't it be great to have a convenient tool, too, in these situations?</p>

            <p>Keywords: Email infrastructure security, Vulnerability detection, Security monitoring, Automated analysis, DNS record analysis, TLS configuration analysis</p>

            <h2>Immunizing vulnerable web applications with AppArmor in practice</h2>
            <p>Linux Security Modules like AppArmor can be a great tool for immunizing applications against their known and unknown vulnerabilities. It can be used for preventing successful exploitation of 0day vulnerabilities, understanding application activity and isolating affected processes as part of incident response without causing service downtime. There are more and more use cases and possibilities, but adoption of these technologies is far from trivial. This talk gives a comprehensive walk-through of using AppArmor for immunizing a web service written in Python, attack vectors and their mitigations via AppArmor, the basic steps of profile development and a simple example of implementing privilege separation.</p>

            <p>In this workshop, the participants are expected to bring their own interesting EVTX files (especially Security events) and analyze them with different tools and techniques.</p>
            <p>As an example analysis exercise, we will cover the triage and analysis phases of an incident response process on MS Windows environments, and see how UserLine (<a href="https://github.com/THIBER-ORG/userline)">https://github.com/THIBER-ORG/userline)</a> helps to improve your DFIR capabilities to focus the investigation. This tool automates the process of creating logon relations from MS Windows Security Events by showing a graphical relation among users domains, source and destination logons, session duration, who was logged on the systems in a given datetime, etc. It is able to integrate and provides different output modes such as CSV output, Neo4j, SQLite, Gephi and Graphviz.</p>

            <h2>Automating SAP Security patches</h2>
            <p>Many large organisations in the world rely on SAP systems for running their business critical processes. These systems are complex and often not properly protected as we have seen during many security assessments. One of the difficulties SAP customers struggle with is to apply SAP Security patches. These so called SAP Security notes are delivered monthly (aligned with MS patch Tuesday) and result in a large workload each and every month because they need to be reviewed, applied and tested.</p>
            <p>In this talk we will present a way to apply up to 75% of these SAP Security patches automatically. This reduces patching time and makes the life of the technical stuff less annoying.</p>

            <p>Will be published, if accepted. Max. 1000 characters = ~200 words.</p>
            <p>Although nowadays most of the websites are running in HTTPS, several parameters can improve the robustness and mitigate risks, especially for highly critical information. It aims to be didactic and point out the weaknesses on basis setup and improvements brought by HSTS, OCSP stapling, HPKP, Certificate Transparency, Forward Secrecy, DNS CAA,.. Different demos will be performed to explain the attacks, their risk and mitigations. The best practices and return of experience of their configuration on popular websites will be detailed to help sysadmin who wants to implement them. At the end, two pictures of the implementation of these parameters usage will be dress-up on most popular websites in Luxembourg (TLD .lu) in July 2017 and October 2017.</p>
