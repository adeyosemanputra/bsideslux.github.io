				  <p>Years ago, we broke operations and development silos, embraced observability and distributed tracing, now we are breaking the security silo: the same way we blended development, operations, and database engineering, we have to embed security in the whole process. Early threat modeling is necessary, and security people have to join platform and application design at an early stage. In order to protect company assets from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, we need to adopt continuous security analysis on code and infrastructure as an essential part of our CI/CD pipelines. New tools and workflows are required, but most of all, we have to complete the cultural switch.</p>

				  <p>Many people are building a custom alerting and monitoring systems for Windows using Sysmon and Elastic Stack, but until recently, there hasn't been a reliable way to centrally monitor activity on a wide variety of Mac and Linux systems for much of the information that Sysmon gives you. You could collect auditd and system logs, but each system has differently formatted logs, and the information provided may not be as robust or helpful.</p>
				  <p>Enter the newly released Elastic Auditbeat System module; it is like Sysmon for Linux. Monitor a fleet of Linux systems for processes, installed packages, sockets, users, and host information. In this talk, we will discuss the Auditbeat System module, advantages and disadvantages, tips for configuring it, and how to use this data to monitor and hunt for intrusions using Kibana.</p>

				  <p>The "S" in IoT stands for security. I have read this line so many times on blogs and on twitter, that I think it is time to do something about it. But how do we make an IoT product secure? Or how do we design a secure product from the start? The answer to the last question is easy, but doing it for an existing product, that is a big challenge. It probably cannot be done in one release, but you have to start somewhere.</p>
				  <p>This talk with walk you through IoT, its components, some principles to design a secure product, the OWASP IoT Top 10 and how to address them, setting up security requirements and controls, and last but not least analyze two popular IoT use cases: a GPS tracker and smart cities irrigation system. These should lay a fertile ground for further discussion.</p>

				  <p>Visibility is key for a blue team if it comes to the protection and defense of a computer network. While the IT and security staff in small companies may have a good view of Internet-facing devices, the roles of these staff members are typically separated in SME or large enterprises. Ideally, a working change management process on top of an up-to-date Configuration Management Database (CMDB) should provide a clear picture of the perimeter. Even if both areas are well implemented, there is always a risk that someone is setting up an exposed device, which is not listed in the CMDB. The security staff needs also a possibility to verify the correctness of the CMDB and to check which devices are actually exposed. Furthermore, the blue team is interested in additional information that provides additional context in order to include the device into the corporate protection measures and to make the right decision in case of a security incident.</p>

				  <p>Once upon a time, an ogre called "SIEM" was invented. Today, if your organization does not have a SIEM, you look like the "Little Tom Thumb" among your peers. During infosec meetups, many people like to brag about the power of the monster they deployed: "We can ingest 5K events per second!" or "We index 3TB a day!". That looks indeed nice but does not impress me so much. Are you sure that you can still find the needle in a haystack?</p>
				  <p>Being involved with such technologies and environments for a while, I had the opportunity to face many situations where the ogre SIEM was not able to return interesting data due to misconfigurations, topology changes, lack (or absence) of logs, wrong normalization and many more. Managing logs and events is not an easy job. This presentation will tell you some nightmare stories that you could also face in your organizations. And, of course, some ideas to prevent them.</p>

				  <p>Almost everyone has heard of the 2017 Equifax breach, and during the aftermath, the narrative was pushed that it was all because of a missing patch. But it was much much more than that! The excellent House and Senate reports point out many issues, and it certainly was not only a failure of leadership but also communication. In this presentation, I take all of the discrete failures brought to light in these reports and line them up with their respective sections in the NIST CyberSecurity framework. This will highlight the cascade of failures that lead to the breach, and it will get attendees to consider using this very approachable framework if they have not already done so.</p>

				  <p>Blue teamers, especially in large corporations, will be familiar with the restrictions imposed upon them by corporate security policies. They have to do incident response and/or incident analysis on machines with limited rights. I have experienced (and still experience) these problems during many years active as an incident responder and malware analyst. To work around these restrictions, I have built a toolset that is purely based on Excel. I have a spreadsheet that is a Windows task manager that can be used to kill/suspend processes, for example. I have a spreadsheet that is a file manager / binary editor. Another spreadsheet can perform many network tasks. Many of these tools are private, but they will be shared with the workshop attendees.</p>
