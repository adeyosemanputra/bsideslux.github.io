				  <p>Years ago, we broke operations and development silos, embraced observability and distributed tracing, now we are breaking the security silo: the same way we blended development, operations, and database engineering, we have to embed security in the whole process. Early threat modeling is necessary, and security people have to join platform and application design at an early stage. In order to protect company assets from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, we need to adopt continuous security analysis on code and infrastructure as an essential part of our CI/CD pipelines. New tools and workflows are required, but most of all, we have to complete the cultural switch.</p>

				  <p>The "S" in IoT stands for security. I have read this line so many times on blogs and on twitter, that I think it is time to do something about it. But how do we make an IoT product secure? Or how do we design a secure product from the start? The answer to the last question is easy, but doing it for an existing product, that is a big challenge. It probably cannot be done in one release, but you have to start somewhere.</p>
				  <p>This talk with walk you through IoT, its components, some principles to design a secure product, the OWASP IoT Top 10 and how to address them, setting up security requirements and controls, and last but not least analyze two popular IoT use cases: a GPS tracker and smart cities irrigation system.

				  <p>Visibility is key for a blue team if it comes to the protection and defense of a computer network. While the IT and security staff in small companies may have a good view of Internet-facing devices, the roles of these staff members are typically separated in SME or large enterprises. Ideally, a working change management process on top of an up-to-date Configuration Management Database (CMDB) should provide a clear picture of the perimeter. Even if both areas are well implemented, there is always a risk that someone is setting up an exposed device, which is not listed in the CMDB. The security staff needs also a possibility to verify the correctness of the CMDB and to check which devices are actually exposed. Furthermore, the blue team is interested in additional information that provides additional context in order to include the device into the corporate protection measures and to make the right decision in case of a security incident.</p>

				  <p>Once upon a time, an ogre called "SIEM" was invented. Today, if your organization does not have a SIEM, you look like the "Little Tom Thumb" among your peers. During infosec meetups, many people like to brag about the power of the monster they deployed: "We can ingest 5K events per second!" or "We index 3TB a day!". That looks indeed nice but does not impress me so much. Are you sure that you can still find the needle in a haystack?</p>
				  <p>Being involved with such technologies and environments for a while, I had the opportunity to face many situations where the ogre SIEM was not able to return interesting data due to misconfigurations, topology changes, lack (or absence) of logs, wrong normalization and many more. Managing logs and events is not an easy job. This presentation will tell you some nightmare stories that you could also face in your organizations. And, of course, some ideas to prevent them.</p>

The excellent House and Senate reports point out many issues, and it certainly was not only a failure of leadership but also communication. In this presentation, I take all of the discrete failures brought to light in these reports and line them up with their respective sections in the NIST CyberSecurity framework. This will highlight the cascade of failures that lead to the breach, and it will get attendees to consider using this very approachable framework if they have not already done so.</p>

How do we introduce the human feedback loop in our Threat Hunting activities? How do we deal with false positives?</p>

				  <p>Like the Internet, the Telecommunications networks were initially built without security considerations. Various vulnerabilities have been discovered across telecommunication protocols. Notable attacks are location tracking, spoofing, call and SMS interception, network stack exploitation, denial of service, and SMS Phishing. It is also crucial for operators to build a monitoring solution that ensures visibility and detects malicious activities. Attackers have increasingly used SMS Phishing as the cost of sending SMS is getting negligibly. Detecting SMS Phishing attacks in real-time while respecting user privacy is an important usecase for Telecom operators. In this talk, we will first give a high-level background introduction about Telecom threats. We will then focus on the SMS Phishing usecase and share our experience and technical details about using Machine Learning in building a real-time detection system from scratch.</p>

				  <p>Everybody knows sudo, right? Sudo allows a system administrator to give certain users the ability to run some commands as root while logging the executed commands and their arguments. It is installed by default on almost all Linux systems and is available for most commercial UNIX systems. Still, even system administrators often only know it is the "prefix" to use before entering a command requiring root privileges. Learn how much more this simple-looking tool can do!</p>
				  <p>Most of the times the default configuration allows a group of users to run any commands: %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL</p>
				  <p>It is a good first step, better than using the root account directly. This way, you can trace who ran what commands on the system. But there are a lot more possibilities when configuring sudo, making your system more secure.</p>
				  <p>Life is simple when you have to give access to a single user to a single command. But as soon as you have multiple users with the same access rights, it is not just shorter but also easier to maintain if you use aliases.</p>
				  <p>For added security, you can add a hash of binaries to sudo. This way, if the binary changes for any reason, like modifying it through a successful exploit, you can prevent it from being used.</p>
				  <p>Using sudo does not make much sense without proper logging and alerting. There are three major possibilities:</p>
				  <ul>
					<li>syslog: all events are logged to syslog. For additional security, collect sudo logs centrally, so a malicious user cannot delete them easily.</li>
					<li>e-mail: sudo can send e-mail alerts on different kinds of failures</li>
					<li>debug: in-depth logging of subsystems, mostly useful for developers</li>
				  </ul>
				  <p>Session recording is a fourth possibility. The terminal output can be saved in a local file and played back. You can play back what happened, even if the user started up an interactive shell.</p>
				  <p>Instead of maintaining the sudoers file on each of your systems, you can use LDAP to configure sudo. It has some differences compared to a sudoers file, but also many advantages:</p>
				  <ul>
					<li>local users cannot manipulate the rules,</li>
					<li>is easier to maintain,</li>
					<li>goes live immediately.</li>
				  </ul>
				  <p>Starting with version 1.8, sudo has a plugin-based architecture. You can replace or extend sudo functionality using plugins. This way, users can keep starting applications the usual way using sudo, but have a different configuration or policy engine behind the sudo command. There are both open source and commercial plugins available. For example, the sudo_pair plugin – developed in Rust – enables monitoring and makes it possible to require interactive approval of sessions.</p>
				  <p>As you can see, sudo has several lesser-known features that can make monitoring and access management easier for large organizations.</p>

				  <p>How many times have you heard this one: "We do not want to move to the cloud because it is insecure; we are losing our visibility and threat detection capabilities!" Even today, one of the primary concerns that security teams have when their organization moves to a cloud is that they would lose their ability to detect attackers. This might have been true in the early days of cloud services, but today, major cloud providers announce new security features almost every month. Traditional network and endpoint monitoring can be adjusted to support security monitoring in the cloud. In this talk, we are going to discuss what services are available and how can we use these new data sources for detection.</p>

				  <p>Blue teamers, especially in large corporations, will be familiar with the restrictions imposed upon them by corporate security policies. They have to do incident response and/or incident analysis on machines with limited rights. I have experienced (and still experience) these problems during many years active as an incident responder and malware analyst. To work around these restrictions, I have built a toolset that is purely based on Excel. I have a spreadsheet that is a Windows task manager that can be used to kill/suspend processes, for example. I have a spreadsheet that is a file manager / binary editor. Another spreadsheet can perform many network tasks. Many of these tools are private, but they will be shared with the workshop attendees.</p>

				  <a href="#Syslog-ng_Getting_Started_Parsing_Messages_Storing_in_Elasticsearch" id="Syslog-ng_Getting_Started_Parsing_Messages_Storing_in_Elasticsearch"><h2>Syslog-ng: Getting Started, Parsing Messages, Storing in Elasticsearch</h2></a>
				  <p>The syslog-ng application is an enhanced logging daemon with a focus on portability and high-performance central log collection. It is used mainly by IT security professionals, but also in Ops and DevOps environments and by embedded developers.The syslog-ng workshop helps you take the first steps with syslog-ng, and shows how you can quickly get more information out of your logs and have greater insight into what happens on your network. Ideal for beginners, but covers advanced possibilities for seasoned syslog-ng users as well.</p>
				  <p>You will learn:</p>
				  <ul>
					<li>The basic concepts of configuring and running syslog-ng,</li>
					<li>an introduction to message parsing,</li>
					<li>how to store your log messages in Elasticsearch, and</li>
					<li>how to display your messages in Kibana.</li>
				  </ul>
				  <p>To try the configurations on your machine, you will need:</p>
				  <ul>
					<li>A recent version of syslog-ng (3.21 or newer: (<a href="https://syslog-ng.com/3rd-party-binaries" target="_blank">https://syslog-ng.com/3rd-party-binaries</a>)</li>
					<li>Elasticsearch 7+ with Kibana installed</li>
				  </ul>
				  <p>You will receive a CentOS VM with everything pre-installed and ready to use, so you don’t have to “pollute” your laptop.</p>
				  <p>Workshop schedule:</p>
				  <ul>
					<li>Theory: Introductory presentation - the concepts of syslog-ng. Explains the different building blocks (sources, parsers, filters, destinations, etc.), and how to connect them together using log statements.</li>
					<li>Practice: Try these concepts in practice. Creating a simple configuration, checking syntax, running in the foreground with different debugging options, and running in the background as a service.</li>
					<li>Theory: Message parsing is a main feature of syslog-ng from the security professional point of view. Most of the log messages on Linux / UNIX arrive in a free form text format, which are easy to read by humans, but very difficult to act on. Using message parsing you can extract actionable information from log messages and create alerts or simply storing data in an easy to search format.</li>
					<li>Pratice: Extend the configuration with a few filters and parsers to make it more complex. To see the results of parsing, we use templates on the output side to include name-value pairs.</li>
					<li>Practice: Store the results to Elasticsearch and display them in Kibana.</li>
					<li>Theory: a quick overview of other useful syslog-ng features not discussed in the workshop, how to get help and support, where to find more information, and so on.</li>
					<li>Q and A session (if there is some time left): touch a few additional topics, based on questions from the audience.</li>
